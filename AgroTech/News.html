                <p>On May 18, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the Law “On Amendments
                     to Certain Legislative Acts Concerning the Sale of State and Communal
                      Land Plots or Rights to Them (Leases, Superficies, Emphyteusis) through
                       Electronic Auctions”. Unlike the current legislation, which provides for
                        land auctions through old auctions that do not use any means of modern
                         technology, the new law will transfer them to electronic format, where
                          auctions are conducted online, without the physical presence of participants
                          , and where the subjective impact on land auctions will be minimized and
                           replaced by automatic actions of the electronic system, writes agronews.ua.</p>
